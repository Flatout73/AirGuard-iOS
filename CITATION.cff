abstract: >-
  AirTags are not the only devices that can be used to track
  you! Samsung SmartTags and Tile trackers have similar
  functionalities. These trackers allow to track your
  location without your knowledge, just by placing one of
  them in your bag, pocket or on your car.

  The protection on iOS against these trackers is very
  limited.
